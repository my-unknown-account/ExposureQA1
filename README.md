**A benchmark and analysis framework for studying how semantic pretraining evidence shapes factual recall, confidence, calibration, and hallucinations in LLMs.**

`Recall` · `Confidence` · `Calibration` · `Hallucination Analysis`

## ✨ Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) often appear to “know” facts — but *why* do they reliably recall some facts while hallucinating others?

ExposureQA introduces **Relation-Aware Support**, a semantic measure of whether pretraining passages actually support a factual relation, moving beyond:
- lexical overlap
- entity co-occurrence
- popularity statistics

Unlike prior work, ExposureQA jointly analyzes:
- 📚 factual recall
- 🎯 confidence
- 📉 calibration
- ⚠️ hallucination behavior

across multiple **fully open LLM ecosystems** and their corresponding pretraining corpora.


## 🔥 Key Findings

- ✅ Relation-Aware Support predicts factual recall substantially better than lexical baselines
- ✅ Confidence strongly depends on semantic supporting evidence
- ✅ Sparse-support regimes are substantially more hallucination-prone and overconfident
- ✅ Calibration consistently improves when stronger semantic evidence exists in pretraining data


## 🧠 What is Relation-Aware Support?

Traditional exposure proxies often fail to capture whether a retrieved passage actually expresses a target fact.

| Method | Limitation |
|---|---|
| Lexical S-O overlap | Subject and object may co-occur without expressing the relation |
| Lexical S-R-O overlap | Relation words may appear without semantic support |
| Popularity statistics | Popular entities do not necessarily imply factual support |

ExposureQA instead estimates whether retrieved passages **semantically support** the target relation.

Example:

> *(Barack Obama, place_of_birth, Hawaii)*

```text
"Hawaii native Barack Obama returned to Honolulu..."
```

Although the passage never explicitly states *"Obama was born in Hawaii"*, it still semantically supports the relation.
